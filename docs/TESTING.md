# Manual integration test checklist

Run this after installing on a Windows 10/11 test machine. Installation is
either `LekhoniSetup.exe` from a release package (double-click; it elevates
itself) or `install.ps1` from an elevated PowerShell session — both install
the same layout, so run the steps below against each path once.

## Language profile

1. Install (`LekhoniSetup.exe` or `install.ps1`) and sign out/in if requested.
   Before installing with the setup program, run `LekhoniSetup.exe --dry-run`
   once and confirm it reports both architectures and the dictionary.
2. Press `Win+Space` and select **Lekhoni Bangla Phonetic**.
3. Confirm the same profile works in a 64-bit Notepad, a 32-bit Notepad, File Explorer, and a browser text field.
4. Confirm the profile remains available after an upgrade, disappears after
   `uninstall.ps1` and after `LekhoniSetup.exe --uninstall` (or Settings >
   Apps), and that the entry is gone from Settings > Apps afterwards.

## Phonetic composition

1. Type `bangla` and confirm the composing text is `বাংলা`.
2. Type `bangladesh` and confirm the composing text is `বাংলাদেশ`.
3. Type `dhaka`; confirm the preferred dictionary spelling `ঢাকা` is shown and committed.
4. Type `bangaldesh`; confirm the typo candidate `বাংলাদেশ` is offered.
5. Type `sonar`; confirm the composing text is `সোনার`, and that `mone` stays `মনে`, `kemon` stays `কেমন`, and `sonta` stays `সন্টা`.
6. Type a phrase from `data\source\phrases.tsv` such as `jiboner`; confirm `জীবনের` commits.
7. Type `valobasi` and confirm the phrase gives `ভালোবাসি`, then type `valObasI` and confirm the capital bypasses the phrase and gives `ভালোবাসী`.
8. Confirm the aspirate and conjunct keys: `chhobi` is `ছবি`, `ch` is `ছ`, `c` is `চ`, `ss` is `ষ`, `kkh` is `ক্খ`, `kk` is `ক্ক`, and `kt` is `ক্ত`.
9. Confirm the anusvara only closes a syllable: `bangla` is `বাংলা` and `bangladesh` is `বাংলাদেশ`, but `nga` is `ঙা` and `ng` alone is `ং`.
10. Confirm the active word has a subtle dotted underline where the host supports TSF display attributes; confirm it is removed on `Space`/`Enter`.
11. Use `Down`/`Up`, `Tab`/`Shift+Tab`, digits `1`–`9`, `Space`, `Enter`, `Esc`, and `Backspace`.
12. Switch between two text fields while composing; the old composition must not be written into the new field.
13. Test Caps Lock, Shift, rapid key repeat, Ctrl/Alt shortcuts, and an unmodified non-text key.

## Backspace editing

1. Type `bangladesh`; the composing text is `বাংলাদেশ` with `বাংলাদেশি` offered.
2. Press `Backspace` once; the composing text becomes `বাংলাদেস` and the candidate list updates.
3. Press `Backspace` again and then retype `sh`; the result must be `বাংলাদেশ` again, with no leftover `দ` and no duplicated characters.
4. Press `Backspace` several times in a row to shorten the word, then type again; the recomposed text must match the letters actually typed.
5. Press `Backspace` until the composition is empty; the underline and the candidate window both disappear and nothing is left in the document.
6. Type a word and press `Ctrl+Backspace`; the whole composed word must disappear, with nothing left in the document and no stale composition state.
7. With nothing being composed, press `Ctrl+Backspace`; the application's own word delete must run normally.
8. With a `Ctrl+Space` suggestion list open, press `Ctrl+Backspace`; the list must close.
9. Repeat the whole sequence in a 32-bit host and a 64-bit host.

## Bangla-prefix and next-word suggestions

1. Place existing Bangla text such as `বাংলা` at the caret.
2. Press `Ctrl+Space`.
3. Confirm the candidate window appears and `1`–`9`, arrows, `Space`, `Enter`, `Esc`, and mouse selection work.
4. Press the shortcut again after moving the caret; no stale range may be replaced.
5. Commit `bangla`, then begin another phonetic word and confirm the local hint list is available without any network access.

## UI and lifecycle

1. Move the candidate window between monitors with different DPI settings.
2. Change focus while the list is visible; it must hide.
3. Minimize the owning application; no popup may remain stranded.
4. Open a read-only text control; typing must not corrupt the document.
5. Close the application during an active composition and restart it.

## Registration diagnostics

The registration helper uses the modern TSF profile/category APIs. It does not directly edit `HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\CTF`. If Windows does not show the profile, check:

- both matching-bitness COM registrations;
- the TIP category entries;
- the display-attribute provider category;
- the current user's language list;
- whether a sign-out/sign-in or TSF host restart is required.
